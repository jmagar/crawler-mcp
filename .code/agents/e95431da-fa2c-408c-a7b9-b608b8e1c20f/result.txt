Context: Service: crawler_mcp (Python 3.11+). Style: Ruff+mypy strict, 88 cols, double quotes. Tests: pytest-asyncio with markers. Entry points via pyproject. The webhook is currently under crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py but already depends on optimized components; we need to invert ownership so the webhook lives entirely under optimized and only references local optimized modules.

High-level goal: Produce an actionable, low-risk migration plan that results in a self-contained webhook under optimized, without breaking external APIs or scripts. Include notes for Docker/supervisor/entrypoint updates and CI.


Agent: You are one of three parallel planning agents. Deliver a concrete, implementation-ready plan (not code) to relocate and encapsulate the existing GitHub webhook server entirely within the optimized crawler subpackage, making it fully self-contained.

Goal
- Move the webhook server completely into `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/`.
- Strict constraint: the webhook implementation must only use code from within the optimized directory and NOT import or rely on any modules from parent directories (e.g., no imports from `crawler_mcp` outside `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized`).
- Outcome: a self-contained `optimized` subpackage that includes a webhook server with its own config, clients, processing pipeline, tests, and CLI/entry point, with updated references, docs, and packaging. Keep API endpoints/back-compat where feasible (e.g., `/webhook`, `/health`, `/stats`, `/recent`, `/batch`, `/manual`).

Repository Snapshot (summarized)
- Top-level:
  - `crawler_mcp/` (main package)
    - `server.py` (MCP server, spawns webhook via subprocess)
    - `webhook/` (current webhook implementation)
      - `server.py` (FastAPI server, large, currently imports from optimized via parent-relative imports)
    - `crawlers/optimized/` (newer, modularized crawler; rich submodules) — TARGET LOCATION FOR WEBHOOK
      - `cli/`, `clients/`, `core/`, `factories/`, `models/`, `processing/`, `shared/`, `tools/`, `utils/`, `tests/`
  - `pyproject.toml` (defines console script `crawler-webhook = "crawler_mcp.webhook.server:main"`)
  - `scripts/` (batch/manual extraction that calls webhook endpoints)
  - `tests/` (pytest; includes `test_pr_embedding.py` which imports `crawler_mcp.webhook.server` today)
  - `supervisord.conf` (runs `python -m crawler_mcp.webhook.server`)

Key Current File Excerpt Locations
- `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py` defines:
  - `WebhookConfig`, `WebhookProcessor`, FastAPI `app`, endpoints `/webhook`, `/health`, `/stats`, `/recent`, `/batch`, `/manual`, `main()` entrypoint (uvicorn)
  - Imports from optimized: `..crawlers.optimized.utils.output_manager`, `..crawlers.optimized.clients.tei_client`, `..crawlers.optimized.clients.qdrant_http_client`, `..crawlers.optimized.config`, `..crawlers.optimized.core.batch_utils`, etc.

Constraints & Requirements
- Create a new `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/` subpackage (or similar) containing all webhook code and only referencing modules within `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/**`. No upward imports.
- Mirror (or re-home) any needed models, utils, config, and clients under `optimized/` so the webhook remains within that subtree.
- Update imports to be intra-optimized (e.g., `from .utils...` or `from ..clients...`).
- Replace external parent dependencies (if any) either by moving their minimal logic into `optimized/` or creating clearly named adapter shims within `optimized/` (still no imports outside `optimized`).
- Preserve existing API contract and env vars where reasonable. Log to an `optimized`-scoped log location if needed (e.g., `crawlers/optimized/logs`).
- Update packaging and entry points so `crawler-webhook` points to the new module (e.g., `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server:main`).
- Update `supervisord.conf`, Dockerfile, and server subprocess startup in `crawler_mcp/server.py` to target the new entry if they remain in use. (Back-compat: the MCP server can still spawn the webhook, but the module path changes.)
- Update tests to import from the new path and add dedicated tests within `optimized/tests` when appropriate. Maintain markers and pytest-asyncio.
- Ensure `scripts/batch_extraction.py` and `scripts/manual_extraction.py` continue to function with unchanged external API endpoints.
- Ensure `.env` and env var handling is localized; avoid relying on parent `.env` unless explicitly duplicated or documented under `optimized/`.
- Keep Ruff, mypy, and CI happy. Strict typing, 88 cols, double quotes.

Deliverables
- A step-by-step migration plan that includes: module moves/creations, import rewrites, config/env strategy, packaging changes, test plan, docs updates, and a safe rollout/validation approach. Call out any risks and mitigations (e.g., circular deps, entrypoint drift, runtime envs inside Docker/supervisor).
- Suggest a minimal file/folder layout for the new `optimized/webhook/` package and the exact new import paths.
- Provide a cutover checklist and a rollback plan.

Notes to consider
- `test_pr_embedding.py` currently imports `WebhookProcessor, WebhookConfig` from `crawler_mcp.webhook.server`.
- `pyproject.toml` console script: `crawler-webhook = "crawler_mcp.webhook.server:main"` must be updated.
- The current webhook uses Rich logging to `logs/webhook.log`; decide whether to keep or relocate to `crawlers/optimized/logs`.
- Keep dependency on `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, and optimized clients within the subtree.

Please return:
- A clear, numbered plan (phases with rationale), an updated target directory layout, key import path changes, and a testing/verification matrix.

Desired output: Concrete, phased migration plan + target file layout + import map + validation steps + risks/mitigations.

Files to consider: crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py, pyproject.toml

**Creating a Migration Plan**

I’m tasked with producing a detailed migration plan for moving the webhook server into an optimized subpackage that's self-contained. This is purely planning, not coding. I need to outline phases, directory layout, import maps, validation steps, and potential risks.

I'll include notes for Docker, supervisor, and CI updates. Key steps involve creating a new subpackage and updating necessary configuration files. I’ll also provide a minimal file layout and map the old import paths to their new locations. This plan has to be concise yet comprehensive.
**Developing a Cutover Checklist and Rollback Plan**

I need to create a cutover checklist and rollback plan, ensuring both are thorough. I'll also develop a testing and verification matrix to confirm endpoints are functional, logs are generated, and CI tasks are completed.

It’s important to update scripts that reference endpoints that are unaffected by this change. I might create a shim module at the old path to maintain compatibility, allowing it to import from the new optimized server. However, I must ensure the webhook implementation strictly adheres to using only the optimized directory code.
**Updating Logging Path and Backward Compatibility**

I need to ensure that we preserve the external API for tests while also updating the console script to the new path. Since tests currently import from the old path, I'll update them to align with the new one and maintain a shim for backward compatibility.

The existing system uses Rich logging directed to `logs/webhook.log`, and I propose moving to `optimized/logs` for a more self-contained structure while considering symlink options to maintain compatibility. It’s essential to allow overriding through the environment while keeping the default at the project root to avoid any disruptions.
**Defining Environment Strategy and Entry Points**

I need to decide on the environment strategy: should we provide an `.env.optimized` file or read from the existing `.env`? We want to avoid relying on the parent `.env` unless necessary, so my proposal is to have `optimized` load its own `.env` file first, with a fallback to the root `.env` if needed, along with clear documentation on precedence.

For entry points, I’ll update the pyproject console script, examples, supervisors, and MCP server to spawn the new module correctly. It’s also important to update tests for CI, ensuring that everything related to `optimized` runs smoothly while providing a phased migration approach with clear tasks.
**Designing the Migration Plan**

I need to create a comprehensive migration plan for the webhook server's transition to the optimized subpackage. The import mapping would change from `crawler_mcp.webhook.server:WebhookConfig` to `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.config:WebhookConfig`, ensuring we detail this clearly.

The directory layout will include necessary files like `__init__.py`, `server.py`, `config.py`, and `logs`. I'll develop a testing matrix covering unit tests, integration tests, and performance testing.

Risks and mitigations will address circular dependencies, environment variable conflicts, and more. I’ll include a cutover checklist, rollback plan, and explicit commands. Each section will be numbered and clearly laid out. The log path will default to `logs/webhook.log`, with configurability options. Finally, I’ll make sure to draft everything concisely while maintaining clarity.

**Plan Summary**

- Move the webhook into `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook` with only intra-optimized imports.
- Keep HTTP API unchanged; provide a thin compatibility shim at the old path.
- Update entrypoints (console script, supervisor, MCP server) to the new module.
- Localize config/env and logging with backward-compatible defaults.
- Update tests and CI; add focused FastAPI tests under `optimized`.
- Validate via a structured matrix; cut over with a checklist and rollback.

**Phased Plan**

1) Define scope and inventories
- Catalog current imports in `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py`, endpoints, models, env vars, logging, and clients used.
- Identify any imports that point outside `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/**`; plan to re-home minimal logic inside optimized.

2) Create self-contained optimized webhook package
- Add `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/` subpackage with server, routers, config, processor, and models.
- Move or adapt minimal helpers under `optimized/` to avoid upward imports (adapters if necessary).
- Configure logging and env loading within `optimized/webhook`.

3) Rewrite imports to be intra-optimized
- Replace `from ..crawlers.optimized...` with `from ..` or `from .` forms under `optimized`.
- Ensure no import in `optimized/webhook/**` reaches above `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/`.

4) Preserve API, add shim
- Keep identical endpoints: `/webhook`, `/health`, `/stats`, `/recent`, `/batch`, `/manual`.
- Create a deprecation shim at `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py` re-exporting `WebhookConfig`, `WebhookProcessor`, `app`, and `main` from the new module with a warning.

5) Update entrypoints and orchestrators
- Update `pyproject.toml` console script to point to the new module.
- Update `supervisord.conf` and `crawler_mcp/server.py` subprocess spawn to the new module path.
- Adjust Dockerfile/entrypoint to call the new path.

6) Localize config/env and logging
- Implement `optimized`-local config with explicit env names; prefer `.env` inside optimized, with root `.env` as a fallback (document precedence).
- Default log path remains `logs/webhook.log` for back-compat; make it configurable (e.g., `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH`) with optional `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/logs/`.

7) Tests and CI
- Update repository tests to import from new path (keep shim to avoid breakage).
- Add unit+integration tests under `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests` for the webhook.
- Run Ruff/mypy/pytest; ensure strict types in optimized.

8) Validate and cut over
- Run verification matrix locally and in CI.
- Roll out with the shim enabled; monitor; then plan shim removal in a later release.

9) Cleanup (post-stabilization)
- Remove shim and legacy references after a deprecation window.
- Fold any duplicated utils back into single sources inside optimized if possible (no upward imports).

**Target Directory Layout**

- `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/`
  - `__init__.py` — exports `app`, `WebhookConfig`, `WebhookProcessor`, `main`
  - `server.py` — FastAPI app wiring, startup, uvicorn `main()`
  - `config.py` — `WebhookConfig`, env parsing, defaults, logging setup
  - `processor.py` — `WebhookProcessor` orchestration (calls optimized clients/pipeline)
  - `models.py` — Pydantic models for payloads and responses
  - `routers/`
    - `__init__.py`
    - `webhook.py` — POST `/webhook`
    - `health.py` — GET `/health`
    - `stats.py` — GET `/stats`, `/recent`
    - `batch.py` — POST `/batch`, `/manual` if retained here
  - `logging.py` — Rich/structlog config utils (optional, or inside config.py)
  - `tests/` — async FastAPI tests with `pytest-asyncio`, markers

- Uses existing optimized modules only:
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/clients/*` (httpx/TEI/Qdrant, etc.)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/*` (batch_utils, pipelines)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/utils/*` (output_manager, etc.)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/shared/*` (types/constants)

- Compatibility shim:
  - `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py` — imports and re-exports from `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server`

**Key Import Path Changes**

- Old: `from crawler_mcp.webhook.server import WebhookConfig, WebhookProcessor, app`
- New (preferred): `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server import app`
- New (typed classes):
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.config import WebhookConfig`
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.processor import WebhookProcessor`

- Internal within optimized/webhook:
  - Replace `from ..crawlers.optimized.clients.tei_client import TEIClient` with `from ..clients.tei_client import TEIClient`
  - Replace `from ..crawlers.optimized.core.batch_utils import ...` with `from ..core.batch_utils import ...`
  - Replace `from ..crawlers.optimized.utils.output_manager import ...` with `from ..utils.output_manager import ...`

- Back-compat shim continues to export:
  - `WebhookConfig`, `WebhookProcessor`, `app`, `main`

**Config and Env Strategy**

- Load precedence:
  - `optimized/.env` (if present) > environment variables > project root `.env` (fallback).
- Keep env names stable:
  - `WEBHOOK_HOST`, `WEBHOOK_PORT`, `WEBHOOK_LOG_LEVEL`, `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH`, `QDRANT_URL`, `TEI_URL`, any existing secrets.
- Logging:
  - Default `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH=logs/webhook.log` (unchanged).
  - Optional `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH=crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/logs/webhook.log` for fully scoped logs.
  - Use Rich or structlog formatting consistent with repo; ensure file rotation if already used.
- Type safety:
  - `WebhookConfig` fully typed, `pydantic` or `dataclasses` validation, mypy clean.
  - Validate URLs/ports/paths at startup with clear errors.

**Packaging and Entrypoints**

- `pyproject.toml`:
  - Replace: `crawler-webhook = "crawler_mcp.webhook.server:main"`
  - With: `crawler-webhook = "crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server:main"`
  - Optionally add temporary alias: `crawler-webhook-legacy = "crawler_mcp.webhook.server:main"` (for manual fallback).

- Include package:
  - Ensure `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook` is included by package discovery.
  - If using `packages` or `tool.hatch.build`, make sure new subpackage is included.

**Supervisor, Docker, MCP Server**

- `supervisord.conf`:
  - Change command to `python -m crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server`
  - Keep same env file reference; add new `WEBHOOK_*` defaults if needed.

- Dockerfile/entrypoint:
  - Replace any `python -m crawler_mcp.webhook.server` with `python -m crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server`
  - Ensure working dir contains `logs/` or create it; set `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH`.

- `crawler_mcp/server.py`:
  - Update subprocess spawn command:
    - Old: `["python", "-m", "crawler_mcp.webhook.server", ...]`
    - New: `["python", "-m", "crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server", ...]`
  - Leave startup behavior unchanged (ports/envs same).

**Tests and CI**

- Update existing tests importing old path:
  - `tests/test_pr_embedding.py` import from `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.config` and `.processor`.
  - Keep shim so older imports continue to work during transition.

- Add optimized-local tests:
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/tests/test_server_endpoints.py`
    - AsyncClient tests for `/health`, `/stats`, `/recent`, `/webhook`, `/batch`, `/manual` (mock external clients).
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/tests/test_config.py` (env parsing, defaults)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/tests/test_processor.py`

- Markers:
  - `@pytest.mark.unit` for pure units.
  - `@pytest.mark.integration` for FastAPI app tests with mocked clients.
  - `@pytest.mark.slow` or `@pytest.mark.requires_services` for tests that hit real Qdrant/TEI.

- CI commands (unchanged):
  - Lint: `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .`
  - Types: `uv run mypy crawler_mcp`
  - Tests quick: `uv run pytest -m "not slow and not requires_services"`
  - Coverage: `uv run pytest --cov=crawler_mcp --cov-report=term-missing`

**Verification Matrix**

- HTTP behavior
  - GET `/health`: 200, expected JSON schema.
  - GET `/stats`: 200, shape/keys stable.
  - GET `/recent`: 200, pagination/count consistent.
  - POST `/webhook`: 202/200 as before; validate side-effects (queued/processed).
  - POST `/batch`: 202/200; confirm batch creation.
  - POST `/manual`: 202/200; confirm manual run.
- Logging
  - File at `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH` created; levels and format correct.
- Env/config
  - Startup with only optimized `.env`: ok.
  - Startup with root `.env` only: fallback works.
  - Missing required vars: fails with clear error.
- Process management
  - `crawler-webhook` console entry runs server.
  - Supervisor starts and restarts successfully.
  - Docker container launches with healthcheck passing.
  - MCP server spawns webhook successfully.
- Type/lint/tests
  - mypy passes in strict mode for the package.
  - ruff passes with repo config.
  - All new tests pass; existing tests pass via shim or updated imports.

**Cutover Checklist**

- Code
  - Create `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/` and implement server, config, processor, routers, models.
  - Update intra-optimized imports; remove any upward imports.
  - Add compatibility shim at `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py`.
- Packaging
  - Update `pyproject.toml` console script to new path.
  - Ensure package discovery includes new subpackage.
- Orchestration
  - Update `supervisord.conf`, Dockerfile entrypoint, and `crawler_mcp/server.py` spawn path.
- Config/Logs
  - Add env precedence and defaults in `config.py`; document behavior.
  - Set default `WEBHOOK_LOG_PATH=logs/webhook.log`; ensure directory exists in Docker.
- Tests/CI
  - Update imports in `tests/test_pr_embedding.py`; add new optimized tests.
  - Run lint, types, and tests locally; fix issues.
  - Update CI (if needed) for new test paths.
- Docs/Scripts
  - Update README/docs and examples to use new module path.
  - Verify `scripts/batch_extraction.py` and `scripts/manual_extraction.py` work unchanged (API unchanged).
- Release
  - Tag release notes with migration details and deprecation of old import path.

**Rollback Plan**

- Keep shim functional: old console script alias can be re-added quickly.
- If issues arise in production:
  - Revert `pyproject.toml` entrypoint to old `crawler_mcp.webhook.server:main`.
  - Re-point supervisor and MCP server to `crawler_mcp.webhook.server`.
  - Redeploy prior Docker image or revert commit.
- Because HTTP API paths remain unchanged, scripts and external clients are unaffected during rollback.
- Maintain shim and old path for one full release cycle; schedule removal with clear deprecation notice.

**Risks and Mitigations**

- Circular dependencies within optimized
  - Mitigation: keep webhook orchestration thin; depend only on `clients/`, `core/`, `processing/`, `utils/`, not the other way around. Enforce via import lints or mypy cycles check.
- Entrypoint drift (console/supervisor/MCP not aligned)
  - Mitigation: single source of truth in docs; test all three launch paths in CI; add a smoke test that imports and runs `main()` under `uvicorn.Config(..., lifespan="on")`.
- Env divergence (optimized `.env` vs root)
  - Mitigation: documented precedence; emit warnings on fallback to root `.env`; add test cases.
- Logging path permissions in Docker
  - Mitigation: create logs directory at startup if missing; make path configurable; add container healthcheck dependent on successful startup.
- Backward compatibility for imports
  - Mitigation: shim re-exports; deprecate with warnings; update internal tests to new path but keep shim for external users.
- Packaging omissions
  - Mitigation: verify package includes via `pip install -e .` and `pip install dist/*.whl`; run `python -c "import crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server as s; print(s.main)"`.

**Exact File Moves/Additions (Implementation Guide)**

- New
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/__init__.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/server.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/config.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/processor.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/models.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/routers/{webhook.py, health.py, stats.py, batch.py}`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/webhook/tests/*`
- Modified
  - `pyproject.toml` console script → `crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.webhook.server:main`
  - `crawler_mcp/server.py` subprocess module path
  - `supervisord.conf` and Docker entrypoint
  - `tests/test_pr_embedding.py` imports (or rely on shim)
- Added (compat)
  - `crawler_mcp/webhook/server.py` shim with re-exports and deprecation warning

If you want, I can draft the exact shim surface, the config env list with defaults, and a checklist of import rewrites based on your current `server.py` contents.
