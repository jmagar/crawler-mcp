Context: Service: crawler_mcp (Python 3.11+). Style: Ruff+mypy strict. Server entry: crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py. We removed legacy crawling tools and need new ones under optimized. Use existing optimized core: strategy.py, parallel_engine.py, browser_factory.py, output_manager.py, config.py. Keep results concise but structured; progress + logs consistent with optimized README. Do not modify files (planning mode).

Agent: You are one of three parallel planning agents. Deliver a concrete, implementation-ready plan (not code) to introduce first-class "crawling" tools into the MCP server using the existing Optimized Crawler architecture.

Goal
- We currently have no active crawling tools registered with the MCP server. We need to design and introduce new MCP tools under the optimized namespace that expose: (1) website crawling (URL seed), (2) repository crawling, and (3) directory crawling.
- Tools must be implemented inside `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/` and wired into `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py`. No reliance on removed legacy tool modules.
- Use the optimized crawler’s core components for execution (strategy/parallel engine, browser factory, output manager, config). Return structured results and leverage existing progress middleware.
- Cleanly separate concerns: crawling tools perform crawl and return structured metadata; RAG ingestion remains in `register_rag_tools` (no hidden coupling). Optionally, provide a separate flag or companion tool to push results to RAG.

Repository Snapshot (key paths)
- Optimized core and utilities:
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/` (e.g., `strategy.py`, `parallel_engine.py`)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/factories/browser_factory.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/utils/{output_manager.py, log_manager.py, monitoring.py}`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/config.py`
- CLI examples:
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/cli/crawl.py` (good reference for parameters and outputs)
- MCP server + middleware:
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py` (current entry; registers `github_pr_tools` and `rag`)
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/middleware/{progress.py,logging.py,error.py}`
- Models and RAG services:
  - `crawler_mcp/models/{crawl.py,sources.py,rag.py}` (shared data classes)
  - `crawler_mcp/core/rag/*` and `crawler_mcp/core/vectors/*` (for optional ingest step)

Constraints & Requirements
- Place new tool definitions in a single module `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py` or a small set of modules; export a `register_crawling_tools(mcp: FastMCP) -> None` function.
- Use the optimized config patterns (OptimizedConfig) and utilities (OutputManager, LogManager) to match existing output structure (output/crawls/{domain}/...). Ensure idempotent and safe directory handling with rotation.
- Progress reporting must use `progress_middleware` and `ctx.report_progress` across: discovery, fetching, extraction, saving, summary.
- Validate inputs robustly (URL vs repo vs directory), provide helpful errors (ToolError), and return a compact structured summary with pointers to saved outputs.
- Keep RAG separate. If we want an end-to-end option, accept a boolean flag (default false) and call into RagService only at the end.
- Documentation updates: README/AGENTS.md snippets, plus example CLI invocations via MCP.

Deliverables
- A phased implementation plan with file layout, API signatures for tools, parameter lists with defaults, import map to optimized core, and structured result schema.
- Test plan (unit + integration) with async tests under `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests` and updated quick/CI selections.
- Cutover checklist and validation matrix (performance sanity, logs/outputs).

Please return:
- A numbered plan (phases with rationale), target file layout, function signatures, parameter validation rules, and example tool invocations via MCP. Include risks/mitigations and rollout steps.


Desired output: Concrete, phased migration/implementation plan + tool API signatures + structured result schema + validation and test plan.

Files to consider: crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py, crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/config.py, crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/utils/output_manager.py, crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/strategy.py, crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/cli/crawl.py

**Detailing a test plan**

I'm planning to outline a robust test plan. This includes unit tests for parameter validation, ensuring progress emission and proper calls to the OutputManager. I'll also perform integration tests using a small local directory and a sample website with an HTTP server. For performance tests, I'll mark any slow processes. Additionally, I need usage examples for JSON requests and responses. Updating the README and AGENTS information is important as well, along with a cutover checklist and validation matrix to ensure everything works smoothly.
**Creating a rollout plan**

I'm focusing on delivering a clear plan for risks, mitigations, and rollout steps. It's essential to minimize code segmentation while still being detailed. I want to avoid assumptions, especially with class names, and instead name modules and use functions like `run_crawl(engine, strategy, browser_factory, output_manager, config)`. I’ll include algorithm steps with progress breathers like discovery and extraction. The final structure will have bold title case headers and bullet points for keywords. Additionally, sections like function signatures, parameters, validation rules, result schema, and more will be included to ensure thoroughness.

**Phased Plan**

- Phase 1: Define tool APIs and result schema
- Phase 2: Implement `crawling.py` tools
- Phase 3: Wire tools in MCP server
- Phase 4: Add progress/logging integration
- Phase 5: Tests (unit + integration)
- Phase 6: Docs + examples
- Phase 7: Cutover + validation

**Rationale**

- Separate tool surface (MCP) from execution (optimized core) to keep coupling minimal, match config/output conventions, and ensure we can evolve internals without breaking APIs.
- Mirror CLI parameters for familiarity and correctness; unify progress and output via the optimized middleware and OutputManager.

**Target File Layout**

- `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py`: new module with three tools and `register_crawling_tools`.
- `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests/test_crawling_tools.py`: unit tests for validation, progress, result schema.
- `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests/test_crawling_integration.py`: lightweight integration for directory and tiny repo.
- Docs snippets:
  - `docs/optimized_mcp.md` (or update existing optimized README)
  - `examples/mcp/crawling.http` (optional curl-like examples)
- No changes to core modules; only imports and usage.

**Imports Map (Optimized Core)**

- Config
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.config import OptimizedConfig, load_config`
- Execution
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.core.strategy import CrawlStrategy, UrlSeed, RepoSeed, DirectorySeed` (adapt to actual names; CLI `cli/crawl.py` is the source of truth)
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.core.parallel_engine import ParallelEngine`
- Browser/IO
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.factories.browser_factory import BrowserFactory`
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.utils.output_manager import OutputManager, OutputPaths`
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.utils.log_manager import LogManager`
- Middleware
  - `from crawler_mcp.crawlers.optimized.middleware.progress import with_progress, ProgressPhase`
- Models
  - `from crawler_mcp.models.crawl import CrawlResult, DocumentRef, CrawlStats` (use existing dataclasses/TypedDicts; if absent, create a local TypedDict in tools with minimal fields)
- Optional RAG
  - `from crawler_mcp.core.rag.service import RagService` (invoked only if `rag_ingest=True`; decoupled from default tools)

Note: For any class/function where the exact name differs, mirror the usage found in `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/cli/crawl.py` (parameters and composition) to avoid divergence.

**Tool Registration**

- In `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py`:
  - `def register_crawling_tools(mcp: FastMCP) -> None:`
    - Register three tools: `crawl_website`, `crawl_repository`, `crawl_directory`.
    - Each uses `@mcp.tool(...)` with JSON schema mirroring the parameters below.
- In `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py`:
  - Import and call `register_crawling_tools(mcp)` alongside existing `register_github_pr_tools` and `register_rag_tools`.

**Function Signatures**

- `async def crawl_website(ctx: ToolContext, seed_url: str, max_pages: int = 200, max_depth: int = 2, same_domain: bool = True, allowed_domains: list[str] | None = None, deny_domains: list[str] | None = None, include: list[str] | None = None, exclude: list[str] | None = None, concurrency: int = 8, request_timeout_s: float = 30.0, obey_robots: bool = True, extract_markdown: bool = True, snapshot_html: bool = False, save_screenshots: bool = False, screenshot_full_page: bool = False, max_snapshot_bytes: int = 2_000_000, output_root: str | None = None, run_tag: str | None = None, rag_ingest: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]`
- `async def crawl_repository(ctx: ToolContext, repo_url: str, ref: str | None = None, include: list[str] | None = None, exclude: list[str] | None = None, max_files: int = 500, file_size_limit_bytes: int = 500_000, languages: list[str] | None = None, extract_markdown: bool = True, output_root: str | None = None, run_tag: str | None = None, rag_ingest: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]`
- `async def crawl_directory(ctx: ToolContext, root_path: str, include: list[str] | None = None, exclude: list[str] | None = None, follow_symlinks: bool = False, respect_gitignore: bool = True, max_files: int = 2000, file_size_limit_bytes: int = 2_000_000, extract_markdown: bool = True, output_root: str | None = None, run_tag: str | None = None, rag_ingest: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]`
- `ToolContext` is the FastMCP execution context with `report_progress` available through middleware. Return value is a compact structured result (see schema).

**Parameter Rules**

- Common
  - seed identifiers: `seed_url` (URL), `repo_url` (https SSH forbidden), `root_path` (absolute or repo-relative; must exist).
  - `include`/`exclude`: glob or regex supported based on core strategy; treat as pass-through to strategy; if both provided and conflict, exclude wins.
  - `output_root`: defaults to `OptimizedConfig().output_root` (e.g., `output/crawls`).
  - `run_tag`: appended to run_id and output path to disambiguate manual runs.
  - `rag_ingest`: default false to keep RAG decoupled.
- Website
  - `seed_url`: must be HTTP/HTTPS; normalize trailing slash; reject non-public schemes.
  - `same_domain`: if True, restrict to `seed_url` effective top-level plus subdomains unless overridden by `allowed_domains`.
  - `allowed_domains`/`deny_domains`: lists of hostnames; `deny_domains` always wins.
  - `max_depth`: 0 means only seed page; enforce `0 <= max_depth <= 6`.
  - `concurrency`: clamp to `1..64`; tune via config.
  - `request_timeout_s`: clamp to `5..120`.
  - `obey_robots`: if True, robots.txt consulted by strategy.
  - `snapshot_html`/`save_screenshots`: only if browser enabled by config; otherwise ignore with warning.
- Repository
  - `repo_url`: must match `https://(github|gitlab|bitbucket).*/...(.git)?`; clone shallow; cache respects OutputManager rotation.
  - `ref`: branch/tag/commit sha; if None, default branch.
  - `languages`: filter by detected extensions; empty implies all.
- Directory
  - `root_path`: must exist and be readable; if outside workspace, return error.
  - `respect_gitignore`: read `.gitignore` at root to filter; use strategy support if present.

**Execution Flow (All Tools)**

- Load config: `cfg = load_config(env, overrides...)` produce `OptimizedConfig`.
- Initialize IO/logs: `output = OutputManager(cfg, root=output_root, kind="website|repo|dir", seed=normalized_name, run_tag)`, `logs = LogManager(...)`.
- Create browser/session: `browser = BrowserFactory.from_config(cfg)` (only if needed by website crawl).
- Build strategy:
  - Website: `strategy = Strategy.for_urls(seed=[seed_url], ... domain/robots/filters params ...)`
  - Repo: `strategy = Strategy.for_repo(repo_url, ref, include/exclude/languages...)`
  - Directory: `strategy = Strategy.for_directory(root_path, include/exclude...)`
- Engine: `engine = ParallelEngine(cfg, strategy, browser, output)` with `concurrency` and timeouts.
- Phased progress:
  - discovery: enqueue and resolve crawl frontier
  - fetching: network or file fetch
  - extraction: text + metadata; markdown rendering if enabled
  - saving: write manifests and artifacts via OutputManager
  - summary: finalize stats; write run manifest
- Return compact result per schema; optionally, if `rag_ingest=True`, pass manifest docs to `RagService.ingest(...)` and include `rag_summary`.

**Structured Result Schema (JSON)**

- `run_id: str` unique (e.g., `2024-09-01T12-30-15Z-<shortid>`; include `run_tag` if provided)
- `kind: "website" | "repository" | "directory"`
- `source: { "seed_url" | "repo_url" | "root_path": str, "ref": str | null, "config": { "max_pages": int, "max_depth": int, ... } }`
- `output: { "root": str, "manifest": str, "markdown_dir": str | null, "html_dir": str | null, "screenshots_dir": str | null, "logs": str }`
- `stats: { "discovered": int, "processed": int, "skipped": int, "errors": int, "duration_s": float, "bytes_written": int }`
- `docs: Array<{ "id": str, "path": str, "url": str | null, "title": str | null, "content_type": "markdown" | "html" | "text", "tokens": int | null }>` limited to first 10 docs (for compactness)
- `warnings: list[str]` non-fatal issues (e.g., screenshots disabled)
- `rag_summary: { "ingested": int, "collection": str } | null`
- `version: str` (tool version to help future migrations)

Note: Persist the full, detailed run manifest (all docs) to disk via `OutputManager`; return only a short preview in the MCP response plus a pointer to manifest.

**Progress Reporting**

- Use `progress_middleware` and `ctx.report_progress(phase, current, total, message)` with phases:
  - discovery: “Enumerating seeds and constraints”
  - fetching: “Fetching N items…”
  - extraction: “Extracting content”
  - saving: “Writing artifacts”
  - summary: “Done: X processed, Y skipped”
- Emit at consistent intervals (e.g., every 250ms or on item boundary) to avoid flooding.

**Tool → Core Parameter Mapping**

- Website
  - `same_domain/allowed_domains/deny_domains` → strategy domain policy
  - `include/exclude` → URL allowlist/denylist patterns
  - `max_pages/max_depth` → frontier control
  - `concurrency/request_timeout_s/obey_robots` → engine/network policies
  - `snapshot_html/save_screenshots/screenshot_full_page/max_snapshot_bytes` → OutputManager/browser flags
- Repository/Directory
  - `include/exclude/languages` → file matcher
  - `max_files/file_size_limit_bytes` → frontier/file filters

**Error Handling**

- Use tool-scoped `ToolError` for bad inputs:
  - Invalid URL, repo host unsupported, path not found, concurrency/limits out of bounds.
- Map internal exceptions to user-friendly messages; include `help` hints (e.g., “set same_domain=False to allow subdomains”).
- Partial failures:
  - Return `warnings` and `stats.errors > 0`; do not fail the tool unless nothing was processed.

**Testing Plan**

- Unit (fast; `-m "not slow and not requires_services"`)
  - Validation: bad URL, non-existent path, repo host mismatch, param clamping.
  - Progress: spy on `report_progress` to assert phases order and at-least-once emission.
  - Mapping: assert engine/strategy called with expected args (use monkeypatch/mocks).
  - Result schema: keys present, types correct, docs preview <= 10, manifest path sane.
  - OutputManager: rotation semantics invoked with `run_tag` and seed normalization.
- Integration (mark `integration`; website test can be skipped offline)
  - Directory: temporary fixture with small tree; include/exclude patterns; markdown extraction on; verify files count and manifest.
  - Repository: initialize a local git repo fixture; add small files; run repo crawl with filters and `max_files`.
  - Website: optional local HTTP server fixture (simple HTML with 2 links) to validate depth and same-domain rules.
- Slow/External (mark `slow` and/or `requires_services`)
  - Public repo crawl smoke (read-only)
  - Website with robots.txt honoring
- Types/Lint
  - `mypy` strict in package; type `ToolContext`, result TypedDict/dataclass; no Any leakage.
  - `ruff` clean; ensure imports grouped and `pyupgrade` friendly.
- Test locations
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests/test_crawling_tools.py`
  - `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tests/test_crawling_integration.py`

**Cutover Checklist**

- Add `register_crawling_tools(mcp)` to `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py`.
- Ensure `progress_middleware`, `logging_middleware`, `error_middleware` wrap the new tools (reuse server pipeline).
- Remove/confirm absence of legacy tool imports; no references remain.
- Verify `uv run fastmcp dev crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py` lists the three new tools.
- Run quick tests: `uv run pytest -m "not slow and not requires_services"`.
- Run `ruff`, `mypy`: clean.
- Manual smoke:
  - Directory crawl on a small local folder
  - Repo crawl on a tiny local git repo
  - Website crawl against a simple local server
- Validate outputs under `output/crawls/{website|repository|directory}/{seed_or_name}/{run_id}/`.
- Confirm logs and manifest present; check rotation works (two consecutive runs produce distinct run folders).
- Optional: test `rag_ingest=True` points to the configured collection and returns `rag_summary`.

**Validation Matrix**

- Correctness
  - Respect depth and page/file limits
  - Include/exclude patterns filter as expected
  - Robots honored when enabled
  - Same-domain restriction effective
- Performance
  - Concurrency respected; no event loop blocking
  - Reasonable memory footprint on 1k-doc directory
- UX
  - Progress phases visible and ordered
  - Responses concise with clear pointers to disk artifacts
  - Warnings informative; no stack traces in user payload
- Resilience
  - Network failures produce warnings, not crashes
  - Permission errors surfaced clearly with suggestions

**Risks & Mitigations**

- Strategy/API mismatch with core
  - Mitigation: mirror `cli/crawl.py` usage and types; add adapter shims if names differ.
- Browser availability (headless)
  - Mitigation: detect via `BrowserFactory`; disable snapshots/screenshots with warnings if unavailable.
- Overly large outputs
  - Mitigation: enforce `max_pages/files`, byte caps, and manifest previews in response.
- RAG coupling
  - Mitigation: keep ingestion behind `rag_ingest` flag and separate tool remains `register_rag_tools`.

**Example MCP Invocations**

- Crawl website
  - Tool: `optimized.crawl_website`
  - Params: `{ "seed_url": "https://example.com", "max_pages": 50, "max_depth": 2, "same_domain": true, "extract_markdown": true, "save_screenshots": false }`
  - Returns: `{"run_id":"2024-...","kind":"website","output":{"manifest":"output/crawls/website/example.com/.../manifest.json"}, "stats":{"processed": 37,...}}`
- Crawl repository
  - Tool: `optimized.crawl_repository`
  - Params: `{ "repo_url": "https://github.com/org/repo", "ref": "main", "include": ["**/*.md","**/*.py"], "max_files": 200 }`
- Crawl directory
  - Tool: `optimized.crawl_directory`
  - Params: `{ "root_path": "/workspace/project", "exclude": ["**/.git/**","**/node_modules/**"], "respect_gitignore": true }`
- End-to-end with RAG
  - Add `"rag_ingest": true` and expect `rag_summary` with ingested count.

**Next Steps**

- Confirm any deltas in `cli/crawl.py` parameters you want mirrored exactly (we’ll align names/defaults 1:1).
- I can draft the `crawling.py` scaffolding and test stubs next, then wire into the server and run the quick suite.
