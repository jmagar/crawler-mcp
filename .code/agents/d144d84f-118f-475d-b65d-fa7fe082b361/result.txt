Context: Background: Crawl4AI arun_many sometimes yields placeholder-like markdown for certain pages, especially when content filters are too aggressive or DOM not fully rendered. Our optimized stack took steps to disable content_filter, add validation, and record metrics, but users still observe placeholders. We need robust end-to-end mitigation with selective retries, better validation, and directory/repo filters. Aim to keep high throughput while guaranteeing no placeholder content in outputs.

Agent: Goal: Eliminate “hash placeholders” appearing in outputs when running the optimized Crawl tool (Unified Smart Crawling). Hash placeholders refer to low‑quality artifacts such as short alphanumeric strings (e.g., 32‑char hashes, or repeated hash markers) that appear where extracted page content should be. We must deliver a robust fix in the optimized pipeline so that crawl outputs (markdown/html/ndjson) never contain placeholder content, while preserving performance.

Context summary
- Server entry: crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/server.py (FastMCP server registering tools)
- Tools: crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py (new tools: scrape, crawl) — crawl uses OptimizedCrawlerStrategy and should avoid placeholders but users see them.
- Optimized core:
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/strategy.py (master orchestration; builds response; attaches embeddings; emits X-Placeholders-Filtered header; uses ResultConverter)
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/parallel_engine.py (arun_many pipeline, content validation, placeholder detection, stats)
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/factories/content_extractor.py (markdown generator setup; TEMP FIX disables content_filter to avoid placeholders; provides quality and speed configs)
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/utils/monitoring.py (records hash_placeholder detections)
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/cli/crawl.py (CLI baseline; hooks for placeholder events, printed warnings)
  - crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/shared/reporting.py (reads X-Placeholders-Filtered header)
- Models: crawler_mcp/models/crawl.py (PageContent etc.)
- Legacy insights: crawler_mcp/crawlers/web.py has many comments labeled “CRITICAL FIX” around arun_many placeholder bugs, including disabling certain modes, ensuring markdown generators are present, and adding JS retry paths. This file is not used directly but informs strategies.

Current behavior
- We already:
  - Disable content_filter in ContentExtractorFactory.create_markdown_generator (TEMP FIX) to avoid arun_many() returning placeholders.
  - Detect placeholders in ParallelEngine._invalid_reason() (32‑char alnum hash, ‘hash:’ prefix) and mark as invalid; Monitoring records metrics.
  - Strategy attaches embeddings if enabled, and returns combined_html / extracted_content from last pages; also emits X-Placeholders-Filtered.
- Despite these, users still see hash placeholders in crawl outputs, indicating either:
  - Placeholder pages are still accepted into results; or
  - The validation or conversion path reintroduces them (e.g., using raw_markdown when fit_markdown empty), or
  - Fallbacks are insufficient (e.g., JS not enabled for specific pages, BFS deep crawl mode, or missing markdown_generator on certain paths), or
  - Directory/repo flows bypass web placeholder validation entirely.

Requirements for proposed solution
- Fix must operate within the optimized stack and tools (no legacy orchestrator usage).
- Prevent placeholders during crawl (preferred) and/or filter them before saving outputs.
- Include retry strategy for borderline pages: per‑URL sequential re‑crawl with JS‑enabled config + aggressive markdown generator.
- Ensure directory/repository flows similarly filter placeholder‑like files (empty or 32‑char alnum lines) and skip them.
- Preserve performance: retries should be limited and gated by detection signals.
- Provide unit/integration tests to validate no placeholders in saved NDJSON and that progress/report headers reflect filtered counts.

Deliverables expected from you
- Diagnose root causes where placeholders slip through given current code.
- Propose concrete code changes:
  1) In ParallelEngine: tighten _invalid_reason() and _validate_content_quality(); add bounded JS retry for invalid pages using quality‑focused CrawlerRunConfig; ensure arun_many batches never accept invalid entries; and propagate reasons to Strategy.
  2) In ContentExtractorFactory: ensure default markdown_generator is always present; consider enabling minimal content filtering safely (or keep disabled) but guarantee no raw placeholder pass‑through; consider strategy to switch to aggressive generator on retry.
  3) In Strategy: after batch, if placeholder count > 0, selectively re‑crawl those URLs sequentially with JS+aggressive extractor; replace entries in pages list; emit header counts and ensure combined_html/extracted_content never include placeholders.
  4) In tools/crawling.py for directory/repo: filter out pages whose content matches placeholder heuristics (empty, 32‑char alnum only) before saving.
- Provide tests to prove fix:
  - Unit: _invalid_reason covers edge cases; retry invoked when placeholder detected (mock CrawlerRunConfig run); directory/repo filters remove placeholder files.
  - Integration (fast/local): simulate two URLs where first returns placeholder on first attempt but good content on second; assert NDJSON contains no placeholder lines, headers show filtered > 0.
- Risk assessment and perf considerations; flags to disable retry if needed.

Constraints
- Python 3.11, Ruff+mypy strict, tests via pytest-asyncio.
- Network access may be limited; recommend implementing tests by stubbing strategy run responses.
- Do not modify non-optimized legacy server paths.

Please return: A step‑by‑step patch plan (functions to edit, pseudocode of changes, config/env toggles), plus a minimal test matrix and fallback strategy if retry fails (drop pages with placeholder). Provide rationale for each change and how it interacts with Crawl4AI arun_many.


Desired output: Proposed patch plan with exact insertion points, heuristics, bounded retry flow, and test plan. Prefer solutions that do not degrade performance significantly. Include reasoning for default settings and environment toggles for retries.

**Defining placeholder detection**

I'm working on defining regex for detecting placeholders, focusing on 32/40/64-character hex/alphanumeric strings or repeated '#' markers. The hash placeholders, especially the 32-character alphanumeric typical of MD5, could follow a pattern like '################################'.

Next, I’ll create heuristics based on the content's hex-like properties, such as low unique token counts or specific patterns. I'll also consider environmental toggles in the configuration to control retries and JavaScript settings for better detection.
**Proposing crawler configuration**

I'm proposing updates on the crawler settings to minimize degradation. I'll suggest running the normal pipeline in the ParallelEngine and retrying URLs sequentially when the invalid count is low, but logging and backing off if it exceeds a threshold.

I'll implement a function to extract the necessary text for validation and create heuristics for checking conditions like HTML tags, document length, and token counts. I'll also look for patterns aligning with hash indicators or excessive hex characters without whitespace.
**Implementing placeholder detection**

I'm considering methods for detecting placeholders like '####' and evaluating content quality through heuristics. I’ll add a function to identify segments with 10 or more contiguous '#' characters.

In the crawling strategy, I’ll filter invalid results and schedule them for retry while managing placeholders effectively. If the ParallelEngine handles retries already, we might not need further action. However, if requested, I can implement a recrawl for placeholders using a sequential approach or propose a method for recrawling invalid URLs as needed.
**Updating content extraction process**

I'm ensuring that the ContentExtractorFactory always uses the default markdown generator and passes an aggressive generator for retries. I want to keep content filtering disabled while making sure that placeholders aren't returned as raw output — setting a minimum token count of 40 should help. If the markdown generator fails, I'll fall back to converting HTML to text for better readability.

Additionally, for directory and repo flows, I'll run placeholder detection on files before saving them to NDJSON, skipping invalid ones and adjusting the headers accordingly. Lastly, I'll create tests to validate these updates using stubs to simulate engine responses.
**Drafting patch plan details**

For integration, I’m simulating two URL responses: one returns a placeholder and the other a valid response. My goal is to ensure that when NDJSON is saved, it has no placeholder lines, and the header includes 'X-Placeholders-Filtered: 1'.

I'll also set up a test for directory filtering by creating temporary files with both placeholder and valid content, asserting that the placeholders get skipped. If retries fail, I'll drop those pages and log 'X-Placeholders-Dropped.' It’s essential to detail a planned layout with proper section headers, pseudocode snippets, and environment toggles for configuration. I’ll include a comprehensive test plan, risk/performance assessment, and add counters for placeholders and retries to monitoring. By presenting everything in a concise manner with bullets and code blocks, I’ll ensure the user has a clear step-by-step patch plan to follow.

Here’s a surgical, performance‑preserving plan to eliminate “hash placeholders” end‑to‑end in the optimized pipeline. It tightens detection, adds bounded JS retries, and filters directory/repo flows—without falling back to legacy orchestrators.

**Diagnosis**

- Placeholders still pass because:
  - Validation is too lenient and/or only checks a single string variant (e.g., accepts `raw_markdown` when `fit_markdown` is empty).
  - `arun_many` batches can emit “valid” page objects with placeholder bodies and aren’t retried aggressively with JS.
  - Result conversion and strategy fallbacks (e.g., choosing least-empty content) can reintroduce placeholder text downstream.
  - Directory and repo flows bypass web placeholder validation entirely.
  - Monitoring records detections but does not enforce dropping or retrying.

**Patch Plan**

- ParallelEngine
  - Tighten `_invalid_reason()` with robust heuristics; centralize text selection across `markdown/fit_markdown/raw_markdown/html_text`.
  - Ensure `_validate_content_quality()` returns False for placeholders and short/empty candidates.
  - Add bounded retry flow: per‑URL sequential re‑crawl when invalid for placeholder‑like reasons using an aggressive JS+markdown config.
  - Guarantee batches never accept invalid entries; propagate `invalid_reason`, `attempt`, `was_retried`, `recovered` to Strategy.
  - Export counters: `placeholders_detected`, `retries_attempted`, `retries_recovered`, `dropped_pages`.

- ContentExtractorFactory
  - Always attach a default `markdown_generator` (never None).
  - Keep content_filter disabled by default, but block obvious placeholder pass‑through.
  - Provide an “aggressive” generator config for retries (JS enabled, network idle wait, slower, higher min text).
  - Ensure fallback to readability/plain‑text extraction if markdown gen fails or is too sparse.

- Strategy (OptimizedCrawlerStrategy)
  - After the first batch, if any invalid/placeholder pages remain, selectively re‑crawl those URLs sequentially using the aggressive config and replace entries in `pages`.
  - Sanitize `combined_html` and `extracted_content` with the same placeholder filter prior to returning.
  - Emit headers: `X-Placeholders-Filtered`, `X-Placeholders-Retried`, `X-Placeholders-Recovered`, `X-Placeholders-Dropped`.

- Tools: `crawling.py` (directory/repo)
  - Apply the same placeholder heuristics to files; skip placeholder files and increment filtered/dropped counters.
  - Propagate headers to saved outputs; ensure NDJSON lines are never placeholder content.

- Monitoring
  - Record new metrics for retries and outcomes; aggregate per run.

- Config
  - Add flags to bound retry and tune heuristics:
    - `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED` (default: True)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_MAX_RETRIES` (default: 1)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_JS_ENABLED` (default: True)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: 15000)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS` (default: 40)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_MIN_CHARS` (default: 120)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_HASH_PATTERN` (32/40/64 len alnum/hex, plus `hash:` style)
    - `PLACEHOLDER_DROP_ON_FAILURE` (default: True)

**Exact Insertion Points and Pseudocode**

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/parallel_engine.py`

  1) Near top: add regex + thresholds
  ```python
  HASH_LINE_RE = re.compile(r"^(?:[0-9a-f]{32}|[0-9a-f]{40}|[0-9a-f]{64}|[A-Za-z0-9]{32})$", re.IGNORECASE)
  HASH_PREFIX_RE = re.compile(r"(?i)\b(?:hash|sha1|sha256|md5)\s*:\s*[0-9a-f]{16,64}")
  HASH_WALL_RE = re.compile(r"^#{8,}$")  # lines of many '#'
  MIN_TOKENS = config.PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS
  MIN_CHARS = config.PLACEHOLDER_MIN_CHARS
  ```

  2) Add a helper to select the best text for validation
  ```python
  def _text_for_validation(r: CrawlResult) -> str:
      candidates = [r.markdown, getattr(r, "fit_markdown", None), r.raw_markdown, r.html_text]
      for c in candidates:
          if c and c.strip():
              return c
      return ""
  ```

  3) Tighten `_invalid_reason()`:
  ```python
  def _invalid_reason(self, r: CrawlResult) -> str | None:
      if r.status_code and r.status_code >= 400:
          return "http_error"
      text = _text_for_validation(r)
      if not text or not text.strip():
          return "empty"
      if len(text) < MIN_CHARS:
          return "too_short"
      lines = [ln.strip() for ln in text.splitlines() if ln.strip()]
      # Hard placeholders
      if any(HASH_LINE_RE.match(ln) for ln in lines[:10]):
          return "placeholder_hash_line"
      if any(HASH_WALL_RE.match(ln) for ln in lines[:10]):
          return "placeholder_hash_wall"
      if HASH_PREFIX_RE.search(text[:500]):
          return "placeholder_hash_prefix"
      # Density/entropy guard
      alnum = sum(ch.isalnum() for ch in text)
      total = len(text)
      if total > 0 and (alnum / total < 0.2):
          return "low_entropy"
      # Minimal tokenization (simple)
      tokens = re.findall(r"\w+", text)
      if len(tokens) < MIN_TOKENS:
          return "too_few_tokens"
      return None
  ```

  4) Harden `_validate_content_quality()`:
  ```python
  def _validate_content_quality(self, r: CrawlResult) -> bool:
      return self._invalid_reason(r) is None
  ```

  5) Bounded retry flow in the orchestrating method that processes `arun_many` results:
  - After first batch, partition `valid` vs `invalid` with reason.
  - If `config.PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED`, retry invalid items where reason is in:
    `{"empty","too_short","too_few_tokens","placeholder_hash_line","placeholder_hash_wall","placeholder_hash_prefix","low_entropy"}`
  - Sequentially re‑crawl with aggressive config (JS enabled). Stop after 1 retry per URL.
  - Accept only recovered results that pass validation. Unrecovered invalids are dropped if `DROP_ON_FAILURE`.

  Pseudocode inside the async run method:
  ```python
  results = await crawl4ai.arun_many(urls, normal_config)
  invalid = []
  valid = []
  for r in results:
      reason = self._invalid_reason(r)
      if reason:
          invalid.append((r.url, reason, r))
      else:
          valid.append(r)

  retries_attempted = 0
  retries_recovered = 0
  recovered = {}

  if config.PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED and invalid:
      for url, reason, r in invalid:
          if not _is_placeholder_reason(reason):
              continue
          retries_attempted += 1
          rr = await self._run_one(url, aggressive_retry_config)
          if rr and not self._invalid_reason(rr):
              recovered[url] = rr
              retries_recovered += 1

  final_pages = []
  for r in results:
      if r.url in recovered:
          final_pages.append(recovered[r.url] | {"attempt": 2, "was_retried": True, "recovered": True, "invalid_reason": None})
      else:
          reason = self._invalid_reason(r)
          if reason is None:
              final_pages.append(r | {"attempt": 1, "was_retried": False, "recovered": False})
          else:
              monitoring.record_placeholder_detected(url=r.url, reason=reason)
              if config.PLACEHOLDER_DROP_ON_FAILURE:
                  monitoring.record_dropped_page(url=r.url, reason=reason)
                  continue  # drop
              else:
                  # keep but mark invalid (Strategy will sanitize)
                  final_pages.append(r | {"attempt": 1, "invalid_reason": reason})

  stats = {
      "placeholders_detected": len(invalid),
      "retries_attempted": retries_attempted,
      "retries_recovered": retries_recovered,
      "dropped_pages": sum(1 for url,reason,_ in invalid if url not in recovered),
  }
  return final_pages, stats
  ```

  6) Implement `_run_one(url, config)` helper that runs a single-page crawl with the aggressive config and returns a `CrawlResult`.

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/factories/content_extractor.py`

  1) Ensure default generator always present
  ```python
  def create_markdown_generator(mode: Literal["speed","quality"] = "speed", aggressive: bool = False) -> MarkdownGenerator:
      # Always return a configured generator
      gen = MarkdownGenerator(
          content_filter=False,  # keep disabled to avoid C4AI placeholder generation
          min_tokens=MIN_TOKENS if aggressive else 15,
          remove_boilerplate=True,
          preserve_links=True,
      )
      return gen
  ```

  2) Aggressive retry config provider
  ```python
  def retry_crawler_config(base: CrawlerRunConfig) -> CrawlerRunConfig:
      return replace(base,
        js_enabled=True,
        wait_until="networkidle",
        navigation_timeout_ms=config.PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS,
        markdown_generator=create_markdown_generator(mode="quality", aggressive=True),
        # optionally: viewport larger, extra wait after load
        post_load_wait_ms=1000,
      )
  ```

  3) Fallback: if generator returns sparse text, fall back to readability/plain text extraction:
  ```python
  def ensure_min_quality(text: str) -> str | None:
      if not text or len(re.findall(r"\w+", text)) < MIN_TOKENS or HASH_LINE_RE.search(text):
          return None
      return text
  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/strategy.py`

  1) Integrate stats and post‑batch repair
  ```python
  pages, stats = await self.engine.run(urls, normal_config)
  # If any invalids slipped (when DROP_ON_FAILURE=False), selectively re-crawl
  remaining_invalid = [p for p in pages if getattr(p, "invalid_reason", None)]
  if remaining_invalid and config.PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED:
      for p in remaining_invalid:
          rr = await self.engine._run_one(p.url, retry_crawler_config(normal_config))
          if rr and not self.engine._invalid_reason(rr):
              # replace entry
              _replace_page(pages, old_url=p.url, new_page=rr)

  # Final sanitization before assembling outputs
  pages = [p for p in pages if not self.engine._invalid_reason(p)]
  combined_html = sanitize_combined_html(pages)
  extracted_content = sanitize_markdown(pages)

  headers["X-Placeholders-Filtered"] = str(stats["placeholders_detected"])
  headers["X-Placeholders-Retried"] = str(stats["retries_attempted"])
  headers["X-Placeholders-Recovered"] = str(stats["retries_recovered"])
  headers["X-Placeholders-Dropped"] = str(stats["dropped_pages"])
  ```

  2) Add `sanitize_markdown/html` utilities using the same heuristics to remove residual placeholder lines (defensive; should be no‑ops normally):
  ```python
  def is_placeholder_text(text: str) -> bool:
      return any([
        HASH_LINE_RE.search(text),
        HASH_PREFIX_RE.search(text),
        len(re.findall(r"\w+", text)) < MIN_TOKENS,
        len(text) < MIN_CHARS
      ])
  def sanitize_markdown(pages):
      items = []
      for p in pages:
          text = p.markdown or p.fit_markdown or p.raw_markdown or ""
          if not is_placeholder_text(text):
              items.append(text)
      return "\n\n".join(items)
  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py`

  1) Directory/repo filter before saving
  ```python
  def _is_placeholder_file_text(text: str) -> bool:
      if not text or len(text.strip()) == 0:
          return True
      lines = [ln.strip() for ln in text.splitlines() if ln.strip()]
      if not lines:
          return True
      if any(HASH_LINE_RE.match(ln) for ln in lines[:10]):
          return True
      if len(re.findall(r"\w+", text)) < config.PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS:
          return True
      return False

  def _filter_and_save_files(files: list[Path], out: IO):
      filtered = 0
      for fp in files:
          text = fp.read_text(errors="ignore")
          if _is_placeholder_file_text(text):
              filtered += 1
              continue
          out.write(json.dumps({"path": str(fp), "content": text}) + "\n")
      headers["X-Placeholders-Filtered"] = str(filtered)
  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/utils/monitoring.py`

  - Add counters and emit events:
  ```python
  def record_retry_attempt(url: str, reason: str): ...
  def record_retry_recovered(url: str): ...
  def record_dropped_page(url: str, reason: str): ...
  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/config.py`

  - Add env‑backed toggles with defaults and strong typing:
  ```python
  PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED = env_bool("PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED", True)
  PLACEHOLDER_MAX_RETRIES = env_int("PLACEHOLDER_MAX_RETRIES", 1)
  PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_JS_ENABLED = env_bool("PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_JS_ENABLED", True)
  PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS = env_int("PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS", 15000)
  PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS = env_int("PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS", 40)
  PLACEHOLDER_MIN_CHARS = env_int("PLACEHOLDER_MIN_CHARS", 120)
  PLACEHOLDER_DROP_ON_FAILURE = env_bool("PLACEHOLDER_DROP_ON_FAILURE", True)
  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/models/crawl.py`

  - Extend page model to carry validation metadata:
  ```python
  class PageContent(TypedDict, total=False):
      url: str
      markdown: str

  ```

- File: `crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/shared/reporting.py`

  - Already reads headers; ensure the new header keys are recognized in progress reporting.

**Heuristics (Precise Rules)**

- Placeholder detection flags a page/file as invalid if any is true:
  - Empty or whitespace only.
  - Total chars < `MIN_CHARS` (120 default).
  - Word tokens < `MIN_TOKENS` (40 default).
  - Any line equals a 32/40/64‑char alnum/hex string. Regex: `^(?:[0-9a-f]{32}|[0-9a-f]{40}|[0-9a-f]{64}|[A-Za-z0-9]{32})$`
  - Contains `hash:`/`sha1:`/`sha256:`/`md5:` prefixes with hex payload.
  - Leading lines comprised only of 8+ `#` characters.
  - Low entropy: alnum/total < 0.2 (guardrail; tuneable).

Only these reasons trigger retry: `empty, too_short, too_few_tokens, placeholder_hash_line, placeholder_hash_wall, placeholder_hash_prefix, low_entropy`.

**Retry Flow (Bounded, Selective, Fast)**

- Default: enabled, max 1 retry per affected URL.
- Trigger: only when invalid for the placeholder reasons above.
- Mode: sequential (to bound overhead), using aggressive config:
  - JS enabled, `wait_until="networkidle"`, timeout 15s.
  - Quality markdown generator with `min_tokens=MIN_TOKENS`.
  - Optional `post_load_wait_ms=1000`.
- Acceptance: only if post‑retry passes validation.
- Failure: drop if `DROP_ON_FAILURE=True`; otherwise return but sanitize it out before assembly.

**Performance Considerations**

- Only retry URLs flagged by precise heuristics; typical pages bypass retries.
- Sequential retries avoid overloading; capped by `PLACEHOLDER_MAX_RETRIES`.
- Early partitioning reduces extra work—invalids are a small tail.
- Fallback to drop ensures outputs are never polluted.

**Tests**

- Location: `tests/optimized/test_placeholders.py` (pytest + pytest‑asyncio)

Unit tests
- `test_invalid_reason_hash_line`: verify 32/40/64‑char line triggers `placeholder_hash_line`.
- `test_invalid_reason_empty_and_short`: verify empty and <MIN_CHARS flagged.
- `test_invalid_reason_hash_prefix`: strings with `hash:`, `sha256:` flagged.
- `test_validate_content_quality_false_on_placeholders`: wrapper returns False.
- `test_directory_filter_skips_placeholder_files`: given temp files with only 32‑char lines and short content, `_filter_and_save_files` skips them and increments header.
- `test_content_extractor_default_generator_present`: factory always returns generator.
- `test_retry_invoked_for_placeholder_reason`: monkeypatch engine to return an invalid page first, then valid page on `_run_one`; assert retry called once, recovered recorded, header counts set.

Integration (fast/local, no external network)
- Simulated two URLs:
  - URL A: returns placeholder on first, valid on second.
  - URL B: valid on first.
  - Monkeypatch `crawl4ai.arun_many` to return simulated results and `_run_one` to return the improved second result for URL A.
  - Run strategy pipeline end‑to‑end to produce NDJSON in a temp file.
  - Assert:
    - NDJSON has no placeholder lines.
    - Headers include `X-Placeholders-Filtered: 1`, `X-Placeholders-Retried: 1`, `X-Placeholders-Recovered: 1`, `X-Placeholders-Dropped: 0`.

CLI smoke
- Invoke CLI crawl with patched engine (monkeypatched) and capture printed summary. Assert counts match.

Type/lint
- Run `ruff` and `mypy` on new code; maintain types on new helper functions.

**Fallback Strategy**

- If retry fails or is disabled:
  - Drop invalid pages from outputs if `DROP_ON_FAILURE=True`.
  - Otherwise, keep pages only internally for monitoring, but sanitize them out of `combined_html/extracted_content` and never write NDJSON lines for them.

**Risk Assessment**

- False positives on low‑content legitimate pages: mitigated via combined heuristics and token thresholds; can tune `MIN_TOKENS/MIN_CHARS`.
- Slight throughput hit from sequential retries on a small subset of pages; capped by config and only triggered for clear placeholder signals.
- Potential over‑sanitization in Strategy: kept defensive but minimal (sanitization only removes pages already deemed invalid).
- Behavior drift with content_filter: we keep it disabled to avoid C4AI’s prior placeholder path; quality is enforced via our own heuristics, retries, and fallbacks.

**Env Toggles (Defaults + Usage)**

- `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_ENABLED=true`
- `PLACEHOLDER_MAX_RETRIES=1`
- `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_JS_ENABLED=true`
- `PLACEHOLDER_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS=15000`
- `PLACEHOLDER_MIN_TOKENS=40`
- `PLACEHOLDER_MIN_CHARS=120`
- `PLACEHOLDER_DROP_ON_FAILURE=true`

You can lower `MIN_TOKENS` to 30 for lighter pages or set `DROP_ON_FAILURE=false` when debugging.

**Why this works with Crawl4AI arun_many**

- Validates content after `arun_many` using robust heuristics across all candidate fields.
- Prevents acceptance of invalid entries in batches.
- Uses a one‑shot, JS‑enabled, quality‑focused retry path for the small set of pages likely caused by content filters or unrendered DOMs.
- Ensures directory/repo imports also never introduce placeholders.
- Final defense in Strategy ensures returned combined strings and NDJSON remain clean even if earlier filters regress.

If you want, I can implement the above changes in a follow‑up once write access is available.
