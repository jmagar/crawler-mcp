This is an excellent and well-structured analysis. Based on your request and my understanding of the codebase, here is the proposed patch plan to eliminate hash placeholders.

### **Patch Plan to Eliminate Hash Placeholders**

This plan provides a robust, multi-layered solution to prevent placeholder content in crawl outputs by introducing a bounded retry mechanism, strengthening validation, and ensuring all crawl paths are covered.

#### **1. Configuration Changes (`crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/config.py`)**

To control the new retry behavior, we'll add new settings to `OptimizedConfig`.

*   **Add new configuration flags:**
    *   `placeholder_retry_enabled: bool = True`: A master switch to enable or disable the retry mechanism for invalid content.
    *   `placeholder_retry_attempts: int = 1`: Number of retry attempts for a URL that returns a placeholder. Default to 1 to keep performance impact low.
    *   `placeholder_retry_with_javascript: bool = True`: Whether to force JavaScript on the retry attempt.

*   **Rationale:** These flags provide control over the new feature, allowing it to be tuned or disabled easily for performance testing or in case of unexpected issues.

#### **2. Enhance Placeholder Detection (`crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/parallel_engine.py`)**

We will tighten the validation logic in `_invalid_reason()` to catch more placeholder variants.

*   **Location:** `ParallelEngine._invalid_reason()`
*   **Change:**
    *   Add a check for content that consists of repeated hash-like markers (e.g., `################################`).
    *   Add a check for content that is just a UUID.

*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```python
    def _invalid_reason(self, content: str) -> str | None:
        text = content.strip()
        # ... existing checks ...

        # New check for repeated characters (e.g., '####...##')
        if len(text) > 10 and len(set(text)) <= 2:
            # e.g., only '#' and newline
            return "repeated_char_placeholder"

        # New check for UUIDs
        if re.match(r'^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$', text, re.I):
            return "uuid_placeholder"

        return None
    ```
*   **Rationale:** This makes our primary line of defense stronger by covering more known placeholder patterns.

#### **3. Implement Bounded Retry in Parallel Engine (`crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/core/parallel_engine.py`)**

This is the core of the fix. We will modify `crawl_batch` to perform a selective, bounded retry for pages that fail validation.

*   **Location:** `ParallelEngine.crawl_batch()`
*   **Change:**
    1.  Instead of just dropping invalid results, collect the URLs of pages that fail validation into a `urls_to_retry` list.
    2.  After the initial `arun_many` pass is complete, if `urls_to_retry` is not empty and retries are enabled in the config, perform a second, smaller `arun_many` call for these specific URLs.
    3.  For this retry pass, use a "quality-focused" `CrawlerRunConfig` that forces JavaScript and uses a more aggressive markdown extractor.
    4.  Merge the results from the retry pass into the `successful_results`. If a URL still fails validation after the retry, it is then permanently dropped.

*   **Pseudocode for `crawl_batch()`:**
    ```python
    async def crawl_batch(...) -> list[CrawlResult]:
        # ... initial setup ...
        successful_results = []
        failed_urls = []
        urls_to_retry = []

        # ... (inside the loop over results_generator) ...
        if result.success:
            if self._is_valid_content(result, monitor):
                successful_results.append(result)
            else:
                # Instead of just logging, add to retry queue
                urls_to_retry.append(result.url)
                if monitor:
                    monitor.record_hash_placeholder(result.url)
        else:
            failed_urls.append(result.url)

        # ... (after the loop) ...

        # ** NEW RETRY LOGIC **
        if urls_to_retry and self.config.placeholder_retry_enabled:
            self.logger.info(f"Retrying {len(urls_to_retry)} URLs that returned placeholder content.")

            # Create a quality-focused config for the retry
            from ..factories.content_extractor import ContentExtractorFactory
            extractor_factory = ContentExtractorFactory(self.config)
            retry_run_config = extractor_factory.create_quality_focused_config()

            # Force JS if configured
            if self.config.placeholder_retry_with_javascript:
                retry_browser_config = self.browser_factory.create_javascript_config()
            else:
                retry_browser_config = browser_config

            # Execute retry crawl
            retry_results_gen = await crawler.arun_many(
                urls=urls_to_retry,
                config=retry_run_config,
                dispatcher=dispatcher
            )

            # Process retry results
            async for retry_result in retry_results_gen:
                if retry_result.success and self._is_valid_content(retry_result, monitor):
                    successful_results.append(retry_result)
                else:
                    # Log final failure after retry
                    self.logger.warning(f"URL {retry_result.url} still failed validation after retry.")

        # ... (rest of the function) ...
        return successful_results
    ```

*   **Rationale:** This directly addresses the core problem by giving problematic pages a second chance with more robust settings, maximizing the probability of getting good content without slowing down the initial high-throughput batch. The retry is bounded and selective, preserving overall performance.

#### **4. Add Content Validation for Directory/Repository Crawls (`crawler_mcp/crawlers/optimized/tools/crawling.py`)**

We need to apply the same validation logic used by the web crawler to file content.

*   **Location:** `_crawl_directory()`
*   **Change:**
    1.  After reading a file's content, pass it through a validation function before creating a `PageContent` object.
    2.  We can reuse the `_invalid_reason` logic from `ParallelEngine`. To avoid code duplication, we can move `_invalid_reason` to a shared utility module or simply replicate its logic in the `tools` file. For this plan, we'll replicate it for simplicity.

*   **Pseudocode for `_crawl_directory()`:**
    ```python
    # Helper function to be added in crawling.py
    def _is_valid_file_content(content: str) -> bool:
        text = content.strip()
        if not text: return False
        if len(text) == 32 and text.isalnum(): return False
        if text.startswith("hash:"): return False
        if len(text.split()) < 5: return False # Stricter for files
        return True

    async def _crawl_directory(...) -> list[PageContent]:
        # ... (inside the loop over files) ...
        content = _read_text_file(p, file_size_limit_bytes)
        if not content:
            continue

        # ** NEW VALIDATION STEP **
        if not _is_valid_file_content(content):
            await ctx.warning(f"Skipping placeholder-like file: {p}")
            continue

        pages.append(
            PageContent(...)
        )
        # ... (rest of the loop) ...
    ```

*   **Rationale:** This closes a major gap where placeholder content could be ingested from the filesystem, ensuring that all crawl types have the same quality guarantees.

---

### **Test Plan**

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   **`test_invalid_reason_enhancements`**: Test `ParallelEngine._invalid_reason` with new placeholder cases (repeated chars, UUIDs). Assert it correctly identifies them.
    *   **`test_directory_crawl_placeholder_filtering`**: Create a temporary directory with valid files and one file containing only a 32-char hash. Call `_crawl_directory` and assert that only the valid files are returned in the `PageContent` list.
    *   **`test_retry_logic_invocation` (Mocked)**:
        *   Mock `crawler.arun_many`.
        *   Have the first call return a result that `_is_valid_content` will flag as invalid.
        *   Assert that `arun_many` is called a *second time* with the URL of the invalid page and with a `CrawlerRunConfig` that has JavaScript enabled.

2.  **Integration Test (Fast/Local):**
    *   **`test_end_to_end_placeholder_retry`**:
        *   Set up a mock server (e.g., using `aiohttp.web`) that serves two URLs: `/page1` and `/page2`.
        *   Configure the mock server so that the first request to `/page1` returns HTML with a placeholder (e.g., `<html><body>d1e8a7f...</body></html>`).
        *   The second request to `/page1` (the retry) should return valid HTML (e.g., `<html><body>Real content here.</body></html>`).
        *   `/page2` should always return valid content.
        *   Run the `crawl` tool against the mock server for both URLs.
        *   **Asserts:**
            1.  The final NDJSON output contains two pages.
            2.  The content for `/page1` in the NDJSON is `"Real content here."`, not the placeholder.
            3.  The `X-Placeholders-Filtered` header in the final report is `1` (or the equivalent metric in the report JSON).
            4.  The final `successful_results` list contains two valid `CrawlResult` objects.

### **Fallback Strategy**

If the retry mechanism fails to produce valid content (i.e., the page returns a placeholder on the second attempt as well), the current behavior of **dropping the page** is the correct fallback. The page will be logged as having failed validation after a retry, and it will not be included in the final output. This prevents any placeholder content from contaminating the results, which is the primary goal. No changes are needed for this fallback; the proposed implementation already ensures it.

This comprehensive plan addresses all user requirements by strengthening validation, implementing a robust and configurable retry mechanism, and closing gaps in file-based crawling paths, all while preserving the high-performance nature of the system.
